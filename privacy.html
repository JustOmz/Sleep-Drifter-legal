  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    Sleep Drifter is designed to work offline. We do not require accounts or logins, and the core features work without you sharing personal information.
  </p>

  <h2>Information stored on your device</h2>
  <p>
    Sleep Drifter stores some settings locally on your device to make the app work the way you expect. This may include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Timer preferences and fade-out settings</li>
    <li>Favourites</li>
    <li>Last selected sound and volume preference</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This information stays on your device and is not uploaded by Sleep Drifter.
  </p>

  <h2>In-app purchases</h2>
  <p>
    If you purchase “Lifetime Unlock”, purchase information is processed to validate your purchase and enable premium features, and to allow you to restore purchases on your devices.
  </p>

  <h2>RevenueCat (purchase management)</h2>
  <p>
    We use RevenueCat to manage in-app purchases and entitlement status (for example, confirming that “Lifetime Unlock” is active). RevenueCat processes purchase-related information for this purpose. This may include purchase history and an app-specific identifier used to associate entitlements with your device/app install.
  </p>
  <p>
    RevenueCat’s privacy policy:
    <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy/</a>
  </p>

  <h2>Data sharing</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell your personal data. Purchase-related information may be processed by RevenueCat solely to provide purchase and restore functionality.
  </p>

  <h2>Support</h2>
  <p>
    If you contact us by email, we will receive the information you include in your message. We use it only to respond to your request.
  </p>

  <h2>Your choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can delete the app to remove locally stored preferences from your device.</li>
    <li>You can restore “Lifetime Unlock” from within the app using “Restore Purchases”.</li>
  </ul>
